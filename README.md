# Disclaimer

This package was [inspired by a tweet](https://twitter.com/aschmelyun/status/1549716246907654144), so take it with a grain of sault :). While it's pretty harmless and can be used in production, you might get some weird looks from teammates. Best to treat this as performance art in a package form.
